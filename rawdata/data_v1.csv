I have been involved in a number of change management environments in the past, some were major (Lloyds taking over HBOS), some were minor (department changes). For me the biggest lesson is communication. not only who you speak to in terms of stakeholders, but how you communicate, what you communicate and when. The communication over the major changes at Lloyds/HBOS was diabolical and you had everything and everyone going in completely different directions and no-one knowing exactly where they were going. It destroyed morale and committment to the role/company. 

The second is timescales. With the best intentions people managing change don't always take everything into account, or take too much into account which delays it, and this massively impacts change timescales. We know of a direct competitor of ours (I used to work there so I jumped ship, it was a very good jump) who is introducing a new operating system, which is a very big change, and the originally expected the change to go-live on March 2015. I think they gave 9 months as the timescale. We know that the new system still has not gone live and last we heard they are expecting to go-live June 2016. So, 15 months past original go-live date clearly indicates that their change management analysis was not thorough and they underestimated the work involved. Massively. 

Ps. They did not hire/bring in change management 'specialists'."

I also think it has changed the therapists' attitude to their work in an unhelpful way - the targets are perceived as oppressive and therefore there is a tendency to focus on meeting them with minimum effort - hence low quality as in Deming's point 11.

One is that each time you log into a different computer for the first time (which happens a lot because you never know which therapy room you'll get or where you'll get a seat in the team base) you have to 'map' the shared drive before you can find any resources. Plus many of the computers are very slow to wake up.  
When running groups the room usually needs to be set up at the start and returned to original state at the end.  Equipment like flip charts and projectors have to be carried up and down stairs and packed away again.  The therapy rooms are in a different building so if a therapist is moving between the tasks of telephone triage and face to face therapy and group therapy (their 3 main 'products') they have to move building and rooms, re-set up the computer and re-find relevant resources.  Plus the therapy rooms can only be booked on the hour, so you either have an hour break or no break.

In a service environment you dont manufacture products so a change over from processesing one 'service' to processing another would not be tangible. We service 6 products in my organisation and n my team we have 145 processes that cover the 6 products and the majority of the processes are transferrable between products. The main difference between the 6 products are their tax atatus/treatment (some are tax free, some have tax relief upfront, some are taxed at source when income is taken) and the tax element is built into the processing system. Therefore, you wouldn't have product changeover.

Going on what Ann Nicholls said, we too have agile teams in that the majority of our staff are trained up on the 145 processes so that when we have a spike in volume on one product/process type then we can move people around very quickly to cope with the volume.

I would say that sometimes this is wholly unnecessary becuase you can get key people in a room, discuss the problem, make an informed decision and leave the room with an action plan to resolve the problem, no need for a project.

One of Deming's points is to 'eliminate targets for the workplace' (number 10). I agree to a point. Sometimes targets are necessary to give staff a 'tangible' goal to work towards. This can create a sense of pride and achievement in the team/an individual once the target is met and maintained."

A lot of our clients send cheques in to us when they want to invest and a cheque takes on average 5 working days to clear through the banking system and then be in the clients investment portfolio. Once there, we have an automated process that sweeps the cash up from the clients 'cash account' and take the cash and invests it in the clients chosen investments - shares, fund, model portfolio etc.

The problem with this is that very often, within the 5 working days it takes for the cheque to clear, the stock market/shares prices/unit prices go up and the client ends up buying less shares/units with their money. We often get client/their financial advisers calling in to complain that theor client has lost out because it took us 6 days to invest their money and we have to tell them that if they had sent their money in to us electronically, not via cheque, they would have invested after 1 working day and not lost out.

We had a situation at a previous company I worked for when one of the heads of department was doing extremely well and her department was a success. She was promoted and the new person who came in to replace her started to see all the problems and the department was actually very badly run. Why did she get away with it? She could talk the talk with the CEO and she had him in the palm of her hand.

A lean programme should and must focus on all of these and more.

Very often the internal lean resources are seen as owners of the lean programme.

Otherwise managers will regard the programme (perhaps even sub-consciously) as interference and will allow it to slowly fade away and die via subtle resistance and lack of support.

Key issues for me would be that graduates coming out of university have not been exposed to Lean so companies who are/have adopted lean need to take new starters through remedial training from their first day. 

Second issue is that when training lean you need to start from the beginning, specifically aroud the principles of lean and what it means to the compoany and suppliers.

Third issue is that the training must keep students engaged at all times, using different styles of training methods and using different techniques. The practical training using Lego is a brilliant example of using lean and apliying the principles with 'moving parts' (Lego). I think that is a brilliant form of practical learning. I might see how I can apply that to my team.

There are 7 main processes so ne spreadsheet for each process. Some processes have 8 steps from start to completion so they would capture each step in the spreadsheet. The team would spend around 4 hours a day updating the spreadsheets. Useless.

I am familiar with Lean so I adopted a lean approach and over a few weeks we removed all spreadsheets. We worked with the business support team to build a report that automatically generated each morning that the team can retrieve, and it showed them the status of each client and at what stage of a process ech client  was. We then split the team into process specific 'sections' and the team manager would use the report to allocate the work out to each 'section'. We also cross-trained the team so that if a specific section didnt have any/enough work, they could support other sections and help with the work. 

This change to the process not only saved the team 4 hours each day, it removed the risk of incorrect information on the spreadsheet. The team could also start processing work from the start of each day and we found that not only did out turnaround times on work dramatically reduce, the team morale and attitiude improved immesurably.

Whilst I fully agree and support improving from the bottom up, without the direction/guidance of top down decisions to implement lean, the company would have probably not adopted/implemented lean. I have worked for a compnay before when lean six sigma was brought in but senior management were not directly involved, it was left to middle management and it didn't work. I think the principles of lean will translate to a service company but only if it is fully supported from the top down. 

One of the key areas where principles can translate to service is regarding project management. Where the waterfall approach is replaced by the continuous improvement approach and this will and is very successful in a service environment. 
Problem Solving is another principle that can translate to service in that a service environment can look at their problems, innovate, identify a solutions and implement that changes. This means the organisation has learnt from the problem and changed the process.

Rule 3 - The pathway for every product and service must be simple and direct - is anothe rprinciple that SHOULD translate to service. Often in operations we make processes to cumbersome and to complex whenre we should adopt rule 3 and keep things as simple and as direct to the customer as we can."

I had to read it in bite size chunks over a few hours, if I hadn't my brain would have resigned. I think smaller companies will have an easier task of doing forecasting because, as the article states on page 11, &lsquo;Group dynamics can, however, have unwanted effects on the time to achieve consensus, the quality of consensus (whether true agreement or acquiescence), and thus, the quality of the forecasts&rsquo;.

I get from this that large organisations sometime struggle with group consensus on how to interpret the data available to them and therefore affects the forecasting.

As we are a small to medium sized company we don&rsquo;t really need to involve our supply chain with our forecasting. The reason is because the majority of our suppliers have customers that are much, much bigger than us in terms of business volume and their capacity planning and forecasting is far more complex and involved than ours. We can therefore piggy bag off their requirements and the suppliers don&rsquo;t really need to get too involved with our forecasting, as it will be covered off in their planning for the large customers.

Going back to the article, I found the Delphi Method very interesting. I did further research and it was developed at the beginning of the Cold War to forecast the impact of technology on warfare. I have been surprised how many methods, tools and principles were brought out as a result of one of the World Wars or the cold war. I suppose warfare does tend to get people/organisations to think differently on how they should manage situations differently, and the knock-on effect could be that these are carried over into business. It is a dog eat dog world out there.

For reporting system for management members and also for KPI evaluation for each GP doctor, we needed some universal measurement system, which reported full overview of maintenance in very short period of time (i.e at one glance).

Green = Highly Recommended Provider
Yellow = Moderate recommended
Red = only in case if Green and Yellow are not available

Well, it was actually 17 spreadsheets used across 5 teams, of 28 people. Believe it or not but 28 people kept 17 spreadsheets updated each day. 

Uselessly hopeless was my verdict after reviewing what these spreadsheets were actually used for.

So, we did away with 16 of the 17 spreadsheet and now use 1, and each team now has a white board at the end of their banks of desks and they update the white boards three times a day. We use the white boards to monitor the work coming in each, what is outstanding by lunch-time, and what is remaining at the end of each day.

It might seem a bit outdated/old fashioned and we could use an electronic dashboard system to monitor this but it is very effective. It is visual, everybody can see these boards, they are updated at key points through-out the day and each team is monitored against the volumes received in and the volumes left everyday.

For an IT system, you can bring in additional hardware, servers, network framework, landlines etc. to cater for the additional capacity requirements, but if you dont need the additional 'equipment' for whatever reason you dont have to use it necessarily. If your forecast for capacity says that you require additional administrators/processors to handle the increase in BAU, and the additional BAU doesnt arrive, you still need to pay wages, pay tax, pay pension, holidays etc. "

For Operations, we dont have a capacity management team that is divided into two functions as the article espouses. Capacity management is owned and managed by each head of department on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.

At this stage I dont know if IT has a single capacity repository or have a web-based repository but I do know that Operations do not have one. We get our capacity management/planning data from 3 different sources.

We have not automated all of our processes and this is due to cost. Our main IT Platform is outsourced so in the majority of cases we have to pay for processes to be automated. We have overlooked this to a point because we know that there is a cost so we tend to focus on the 'here and now' development requirements, rather that future/capacity planning of these."

The How to Get Ready to Instruct card seemed like basic common sense to me. But it is good that the supervisors are clear on what is expected of them. As TWI bypasses employees emotional reluctance to conforming to a standard way, this to me would ensure employees buy in and ensure that all work together towards the same goals.
Taking this into the team I manage, I can see how some of this would work in some of the straight forward process type work, however as an underwriter not everything is black and white and some things are subjective so cannot always conform to standard work."

For admin I think best that they can perform all the tasks confidently although in training we do train one task at a time (over 1-2 weeks).  For the therapists, this is something we have discussed quite a lot.  How far should we expect all therapists to be competent in treating depression and complex grief and binge eating and chronic fatigue and OCD etc etc.  Certainly those from specialist teams think this would be impossible, and competence comes from treating the same type of problem over and over.  However, going too far down this line makes us inflexible (e.g. if the specialist in postnatal depression doesn't have a slot available when the patient with postnatal depression can get childcare to actually get to an appointment, and we have the new waiting time target for perinatal patients to meet).  So we have gone for a middle road approach where we do have specialists, but we expect most therapists to work with most problems but using the specialists for consultation and supervision. Therapists seem to value both the variety and the opportunity to become a specialist.  With the PWPs the situation is more as Nicola describes.  First we expect them to be able to support patients through a BA programme for depression, then when they are confident with that, they move onto graded exposure and/or techniques for worry, then later on they learn how to work with insomnia and low self-esteem, etc.  This seems to work well in developing competence and maintaining engagement.

The is the client, financial advisers, Novia, and a number of third party suppliers that we need to fulfill/complete a process. For example, we use a company called FinEx who provide us with pricing for funds and shares on the London Stock Exchange and when we provide valuation for our clients portfolio's, we use FinEx to value the clients portfolio. Without this we wouldn't be able to provide an accurate valuation.

There are different types of online therapy and in some we'd be foolish to try to compete i think, but in others what's there is not great. Also the first generation of so-called computerised CBT (cognitive behaviour therapy) pretty much failed and it will be interesting to see if the next generation do better.  Imagine they should, the first lot were bad in obvious ways (mainly just putting content of self-help books on a screen - new concepts drawing on ideas about how people learn / engage etc definitely needed).  But anyway not sure if the organisation is willing to make the necessary investment. And would be better not to do than to do badly.
May also be opportunities for online training of therapists - not sure who if anyone is really doing that yet.  Why not I wonder.

Our biggest problem is the waiting time for individual therapy.  We tried some things to get a grip a year or so back with moderate success, but then in 2014-15 there was enormous pressure to take more patients into the system (basically a national activity target based on inputs, not outputs) and so we obligingly met the target (not that it was easy), and i did explain to the CCG that all the time i was helping meet their target I was essentially adding people to a waiting list.  We are now living with the consequences, and the input target hasn't gone away.   And the man on the video is absolutely right, that apart from the fact that it is awful for patients, it leads to all sorts of time-wasting e.g. taking calls from patients and referrers who want to know where they are on the waiting list and you hope aren't going to put in a formal complaint because that will just be more wasted time; trying to contact patients at the top of list who have in fact now moved out of the area or got a private therapist or are just plain uncontactable, offering more than the normal therapy to compensate for feeling guilty that they waited, time pressure so making bad decisions about who should be on which list, writing long responses to the commissioners to explain why it is the way it is and what we are going to do about it, dealing with the negative impact on staff morale, etc.
It is an interesting idea to just stop adding people to the list - I think we could do that (not allowed to reduce the number coming in, but could send them to a different process - in fact I have been trying to encourage a limited version of this with mixed success - to do more aggressively would mean diverting resources from taking people off the list, so would need sums to check if really would make things better,

I support most therapists who want to train in a second therapy to do so, but then I am reluctant for them to train in a third, although there are requests for that.  That's because having therapists trained in two seems to give more or less enough flexibility (i.e. no one waiting list is spectacularly worse than the others, we can cope reasonably well with staff turnover), but because each therapy requires its own supervisor and CPD time, etc. people doing only one are potentially the most productive, so allowing more than two is wasteful.

You can see that Netflix has listened to their customers and not only provide access to many films instantly but it now creates and tailors its own shows for distinct customer segments. Are customers more interested in the 'Box Set' type product than a 2 hour film? I think their recent successes have led them to see off stiff competition and by delivering what the customer wants will ensure their continued success.

The questions are very simply linked into the service that they receive from my team. These results are then analysed in minute detail and then we act on any areas that need strengthening. This is how we try to get inside our internal customers heads. We have some way to go with our external customers but we have introduced 'real time' feedback that a customer can give us on their experiences and I use these to drive behaviours within the team.

It is all fine and well wanting to fundamentally rethink and radical redesign your business processes, but if your outsourced platform technology provider (we outsource our technology) is not willing to work with you unless you pay them exorbitant sums of money, it's not going to happen. In my operations department, we have around 100 enhancements we want to make to our proposition across a number of areas. One process that is high volume, high impact and very manually intensive is somethine we want to automate. As per section 2, we want to simplify the process. In a previous company I worked for as Proposition Manager, I designed this process and how it should work so I know it is possible to automate. My current companies technology provider wants to charge us &pound;100,000 just to do the initial design of concept. This figure is too high for us to request funding for at this stage. The Taco Bell case study is a very interesting one, focussing on the customer first showed that Taco Bell were wrong in their assumption about what the customer wanted. They re-engineered around the cccustomer. In our industry we have two customers for each product; the financal adviser and the end-client. They each have very different requirements from us and that is a challenge. I always ask the question: which client is more important? The client who recommends and ultimately decides to buy our product (the adviser), or the client whose money is used to buy the product (the end client)? Point 4 of the key to re-engineering success, accept imperpections along the way, is key for me. We are humans and we make mistakes, learn from them and move on."

We have seen a massive developments in IT over the past few decades and the pace of advancement seems to be continuous. Therefore things that would have been impossible a few years ago may now be possible. I did like the Ford case study and the efficiency savings were huge.

They want to have one person gathering the referrals and printing them out, another person entering the data, and another calling the patient.  I have tried to understand why because to me this wastes time (because the patient record has to be opened twice instead of once, lists have to be checked so patients don't get lost, etc.).

The book spoke about treating the past and your future as two completely different entities. The story of the 4 monkeys in a room is interesting because that is a good example how 'experienced and knowledgable' managers sometimes treat new kids on the block in their company.

There is a good business saying, not sure who said it, which is 'today's problems are as a result of yesterday's solutions'.

Stage 1 is Internal Neutrality; how could you call something neutral when it is the very poorest level of contribution by operations? I wouldnt say being poor at something is being neutral. Anyway, moving on. My takeaway point is that you can use this four-stage model to identify where operations is in terms of contribution to a company. Once you have identified which stage it is at, your strategic approach on how you take operations forward/move to the next stage will be more focused. I can identify that when I joined my company, we were at stage 1. We drastically changed how operations functioned and we moved to stage 2 and in some areas we are still in stage 2 but in other areas we are in stage 3.

Externally some things may not matter so much to the customer but internally you should still want to improve as ultimately improvements will save cost. An example could be a customer is happy to wait 10 days for his insurance policy documents but if the quality is low and they are having to be re-worked then this will have a cost implication. You are still delivering on what the customer expects (as long as you do get them out in a timely manner) but it's costing you more to do so.

It would save time / money if the process were more dependable. And we have several processes like this.

I would say most of what we do is highly visible, and there is a push to make things more visible still (e.g. so that patients always know where they are on the waiting list, have more service user involvement, etc.)."

VOLUME - I would have to say that this is fairly high as we have masses amounts of workitems that require to be worked which can be very different in nature.
VARIETY - We have many different products and offerings, all requiring different processes and skill sets to handle. 
VARIATION - We can usually predict with some degree of accuracy the amount of work we will get in and although there are peaks and troughs they are not huge. So I think this would be Middle to Low.
VISIBILITY - This is a tricky one but I think it would be Middle to High. Our customers can ask anything and they do have a good understanding of how we work.

However, the cliebt could have also made more money as a result of our mistake so sometimes our mistake could be a financial advantage for the client.

We see that one of the key roles management play is guiding, informing and supporting staff in everything they do, we do not play the 'blame game'. The difficulty we have implementing this philosophy is that the staff are either hesitant, or do not want to make decisions. They feel that if they make the wrong decision and things go wrong that they will be severely reprimanded or looked down upon. Nothing could be further from that, within reason of course. I suppose this is as a result of the top down management approach most people have become acustomed to.

We did a lot of work for the Hyundai CKD (Complete Knock Down) vehicle manufacturing plant and a CKD plant build cars from scratch, except for the engine, gearbox and car panel parts (door, bonnet, boot etc.). As Hyundai is a South Korean company they used Lean production and is was very impressive to see lean in operation, I got to see it up close over a period of around 6 months. The plant was huge and the stock room was about the size of a front room in a terraced house. The real challenge they had was getting all the parts to build the cars in time because the main suppliers were based in South Africa, this meant the logistics of long distance haulage/transport and border crossing played a big part in planning and forecasting. I don't think Toyota in Japan would have had the same logistical problems as Hyundai in Botswana."

Wherever possible, we collect NPS survey data in face to face interviews conducted by an 'independent' person from our organisation. This is precisely to overcome the potential problem that Richard highlights of customers being hesitant to provide frank, open and honest (negative) feedback to individuals providing the service. There is a skill required to do this effectively, asking open questions, noticing body language and voice tone intonation (which make up 70% of communication). The bit we could be better at is the speed at which this feedback is relayed to operational staff, and the speed and consistancy with which they use this to initiate a service recovery (where required). We did try to get operational teams to produce service improvement plans on the back of feedback to share with customers. When this was done it was successful, but not wideky adopted, as it was viewed as 'just another thing to do'."

So much to take from this: The waiting-line experience in a service facility significantly affects our overall perceptions of the quality of the service provided. Quote of the day ' Products are consumed, services are experienced'.   Maisters first law of service , satisfaction = Perception - Expectation. Service managers must pay attention to three things: what was actually done for the customer (normally the main focus), what was perceived by the customer (often neglected) and what the customer expected (usually totally ignored). If initial expectations are not met (or exceeded) it's almost impossible to turn the situation around  Maisters second law of Service ' It's hard to play catch up ball', conversely met or exceeded expectations  at early stages create a halo effect, therefore the largest payback may well occur at early stages. Occupied time feels shorter than occupied time - enter left Goofy in the Disney queue. People want to get started and those involved in pre-process waits are perceived as longer than those in-process waits (have I been forgotten factor). Anxiety makes waits seem longer so anticipating what customers might be worrying about (rationally or irrationally) is important in service design.This gives customers perceived control and certainty. Customer appointments establish expectations, waits resulting from failure to deliver seem longer than if no appointment had been made. Unexplained waits seem longer than explained waits, credibly explained delays reduce dissatisfaction. Waiting in ignorance creates a feeling of powerlessness. Unfair waits are longer than fair waits. Receptionist answering the phone rather than giving priority to a visitor who is present is an example of perceived inequity. The more valuable the service (to the customer), the longer the customer will wait. Waiting for something of little value (to the customer) can be intolerable. Post process waits can seem the longest of all since the service is over and there is no more value to be received. There is some form of comfort in group waiting as opposed to perceived individual waiting! Dealing with this service area sensitively can have a significant impact upon the customers service experience."

The 'Employees that scan items in shoppers carts before they reach the cashier ' has been adopted by Starbucks and a few others. If you shop online like I do, you even 'pay' before you have your goods (or just after they have been delivered). Seemingly separating the act of paying from the act of receiving the goods or service is not so problematic if the customer trusts the service provider. 'After three minutes (of waiting), the perceived wait time multiplied with each passing minute', very interesting but more to do with managing customer expectatations than managing queues. This is precisely why London Underground have installed dot matrix display boards on each platform, to manage customers perception of their expected waiting time. 'Customers felt less stressed when there was an employee or an electronic screen near the front of the line to direct shoppers to the next open register' , managing waiting expectations again. Perceived speed of service (gauged by how fast the till lanes were moving) is an indicator of satisfaction not only of the speed of service but also the store itself. My favourite though is ' a single-file line leading to three cashiers is about three times faster than having a separate line for each cashier', I have witnessed this in action and also seen the 'jockey for position' in separate lines, this seems bonkers or perhaps they are just not in a hurry to be served."

Focusing on moments of truth, rather than all touch points is also an important point (  focusing on creating memorable experiences). I also liked the suggested levers of ; clarity of purpose for frontline people, improving capabilities of employees, acquiring the right emotional skills, structures reward systems and processes to back up changes and existing frontline leaders serving as role models ( 80% of culture comes from leaders). Having performance incentives linked to customer experience is a key change, it will ensure that this is consistently measured and focused on."

Now, the way Steve Job introduces the store, even when this was over 10 years ago, I still find it amazing. The best part for me, the area dedicated to help customers solved any issue. You are investing in a top quality equipment, and you certainly want to get the best out of it. I'm certain that you are convinced about the quality once you start using the equipment, but if on top of that, you have the assurance that there are experts out there that can guide you and solve any issue for you, you will buy their products over and over again. I also liked the area where you can 'experience' for yourself. We should have more of that in our own premises, so much to offer, but show so little. "

The journey focuses on what you can do with the products, what other ( non apple) products can be used with their products. They are also totally focused on customers being able to get the best from their Apple products. The Genius Bar is an excellent illustration of this ' we'll guarantee to find a solution to your problem, and if we can't , we've got a hot line to the people that made them' . The other striking thing is that the whole customer journey is designed to be experiential, they want you to play and experience their products and what they can do. The store is also structured very purposefully, this is what we have, this is what you could do with what we have, here are some other products that you can use with ours to do even more."

The Genius Bar has been copied by any number of PC stores, and it really works. Apple was over a decade ago though. To be honest, even though it was, it was well ahead of it's time, and would still be a great example of designing the customer journey if it was introduced today.

Apple were not the first to market with any of their products but invested significant effort into 'making complex things simple'. I really like the idea of the Genius Bar, which dispenses free advice and help with the sole purpose of helping people to have the best possible experience. (This is something we could replicate with staff as well as customers). Allied to this, I also like the idea of free classes, what a fantastic way to engage your customers. In a similar way to John Lewis, Apple don't focus on selling products, they focus on the outcomes for customers of using those products, their experiences. There also focus on the finest details too, (I had noticed the attention to detail bestowed on their packaging). This inevitably focuses on the customers emotional response to their experiences.
Underpinning all of this is the clarity of mission ' To help people to find out what they need, and help them get it'. This then shapes their recruitment policies (Its harder to work at Apple than get into Harvard), the design of their stores, their services their commitment to continually improve what they do. Another recurring theme is one of surprise and delighting customers, instantly exceeding expectations. I liked the service strategy acronym (and have already thought about how we could adapt this). The importance of recruiting staff with the right behaviours shines through again. The empowerment of customers, whether visitors to their stores or online, provides a more engaging user experience whilst simultaneously improving Apples ability to personalise its services.

Its important that if customers associate your organisation with high availability then a 1% increase in consistency will have more of an effect than a 1% increase in recovery.  I expect then that the opposite is also true - a 1% decrease in consistency will be more detrimental for those firms. interesting to read that traditional inventory models do not relate customer demand and service level.  If aware managers can use these levers to increase demand dependent on costs and benefits of changing either lever.

Interesting to note that a quality product is now always expected by the customer and is not the main reason for their return.

Following up with calls to dissatisfied customers and most importantly having gained permission to call them prior to the call is an excellent approach not only to find out how to improve the process but by asking permission shows a respect for the customer's time and privacy. This respect is also shown by length of their survey - 2 questions.

We sent out letters detailing a Corporate Action to clients. Tens of clients then phoned our helpline complaining that they couldnt understand the letters, that they were highly confusing. I then looked at the letters, showed them to my boss, we could barely understand them. The letters were sent out from our Zurich office, nevertheless we should all have looked at the letters before they went out and asked ourselves if we would be happy receiving one. Now there is a major inquest going on as to why the letters were sent out. Had we had sufficicent checks in place beforehand, this could have been avoided.

In my own business we have a Client Experience team and they often run presentations around these themes. I attended one last year and they talked about the disasterous consequences of negative word of mouth to any business. They used an example that if one of our clients, say a barrister, had a bad experience with us that there was a great likelihood that this would be shared with other barristers in their chamber, who could be potential clients. Also, my own personal experiences concur with this paper. Many years ago I had a terrible experience with Ryanair, and since then have flat refused to fly with them again, and tried to persuade many people to avoid them. Yet practically every flight I take within Europe is on easyjet. Irrespective of the slight cost differential between the too. Both airlines offer low cost routes to the continent, but easyjet always seem to me to have had a better understanding of customer service, and as I result of this I have remained a loyal customer."

Also the importance of trying to be positive in our interactions (and lets be honest we all have our bad days) and recognising that although for the most part our Operations units are not customer facing we are all mouthpieces for the company whether we are speaking to other employees or external parties formally or informally.  The open letter to employees was interesting.  Similarly to Amazon we are a publicly quoted company and press releases tend to happen late in day with staff announcement after 5pm.  The late announcing of news is a source of frustration for staff as they may be already gone from office and are hearing the news from external parties or there is no one to discuss the news with at that late point in the day.

Two 45 minute phone conversations to a customer services dept in a furniture firm who messed up my delivery- in both the conversations the customer service was appalling as they did very little to rectify their mistake or even show remorse. One tweet from me and later that afternoon I got a phone call from another division of the company who resolved my issue with a more suitable rede livery date.

So, in some instances we would like to make our services visible, but then extra care is required to the message the customer is receiving while watching the process in practice. Although the employees might be doing the right operations, the perception might be totally different. Next, also very important is lack of information. A well informed customer in the queue behaves totally different while in queue. He might feel empathy or decide to leave the queue, but in any case we provide him with a choise and feel of having the control over the process.

At Disney, the ride starts at the entrance to the ride/ the queue - not at the roller coaster cart like it does at other theme parks. The haunted mansion has an extended queue that involves a lift and a corridor before you actually board the ride. The experience is half way through before the traditional 'ride' has even started.
There are also additional attractions that split the crowds into other areas - such as parades, the castle, a dragon (in Paris), sword in the stone etc. 
The message to take from this is that there are ways to divert resource/customers etc that can actually enhance the experience - if you are clever with it you can turn a negative but compulsary aspect of your transaction/customer experience into a positive that differentiates you from the competition."

Leassons learned could be ''de-escalation of situation'' but that is just a way of hanndling. The video shows only the personnel's point of view, this does not assure us that service is adequate or that clients in most cases are receiving a lower than expected service. 
Comparing to my own country far before the crisis, NHS is really on the lower service band given the size of economy and popullation.

What comes across as 'penny pinching' doesn't do the company any favours in the long run, because focus is on that instead of the issues that really affect profit and loss and what the lowly employee could actually do the improve this. My more successful employers have realised that by making employees part of the big picture - having them bought into the concepts of profit and loss and appreciating the impact of their personal actions- the general attitude changes and subsequently it changes to everything. The engaged employee takes ownership of all their actions, and doesn't go to the stationary cabinet unnecessarily! 
To link to Emma's point, this could be easier in Singapore than in UK society, but there's nothing wrong in trying to establish this attitude within the culture of your own company."

Some organisations build internal structures and processes that seem to serve no one but their own internal structures - people actually forget what the core business is. "

a) If you're business offers a high end service then you might want to stay away from anything that could be associated with 'cheap and cheerful' - and therefore convenient. It is unlikely that in my company we would get a positive response if we expected our policy holders to print their policies at home.
b) If the customer is spending a lot of money then they will want to be 'wined and dined' to a degree. In this instance convenience is replaced by the company 'doing it for you' to give the perceived feeling of better value. You expect the garage to sort out your tax disc when buying a new car for example. Not just because it's more convenient than going to buy the disc yourself, but because you have just paid thousands of pounds for their product. c) There is no point having a system that claims efficiencies if the technology isn't there to back it up - it just annoys the customer.

Once you accept the idea of trade-offs&mdash;and break the addiction to service heroes&mdash;the inputs into service excellence are much easier to consume. We lay out these inputs in a framework we call the four service truths, which are the assumptions behind the basic elements of a successful, high-service model: a service offering, a service funding mechanism, an employee management system, and a customer management system. These four truths act as the mental cornerstones of a sustainable model for delivering uncommon service:

    You can't be good at everything. You must be bad in the service of good. Excellence requires underperforming on the dimensions your customers value least so that you can overperform on the dimensions your customers value most. Once you choose this path, the decision on where to be good and bad should by driven by deep insight into who your customers are and what they need operationally.
    Someone has to pay for it. Service excellence must be funded in some way. You can find a palatable way to charge your customers more for it, reduce costs while improving your service experience, or get customers to do some of the work for you. Choosing among these strategies-finding the right funding mechanism for your business-will depend on both industry dynamics (e.g., price sensitivity) and the specific relationship you have with your customers.
    It's not your employees' fault. Your people matter, but not because they're the make-or-break input on delivering uncommon service. What matters more is the way you've designed your service model, in particular, the way the model sets up average people to excel as a matter of routine. Rather than creating an environment where employees have the time and space to focus on satisfying customers, many service organizations today are actually undermining their people's ability to serve.
    You must manage your customers. You must be deliberate about involving your customers in creating-not just consuming-your service experience. In other words, you also need a management plan for your customers. To return to our manufacturing metaphor, the special challenge of service delivery is that your customers routinely wander onto the shop floor-unannounced-and tinker with the assembly line. And yet success isn't just a matter of keeping them out of trouble. Your customers need to play a productive role on the line itself, and to do so, they need training, guidance, safety goggles-and more.

What could be some key skill sets and are they easily developed to meet company&rsquo;s strategy? 
Second, if the service experience is poor, that clearly shows a misalignment of company&rsquo;s strategy with the business portfolio and vision. So, in a few words, appointing a single person without having a total service strategy vision can be equally vague as before if managements does not indetify the gap to the customer&rsquo;s experience.

I like the idea that within three minutes the problem has been identified and resolved or a decision made to shut down an entire factory. The way they plan for the next 50 years is unheard of.

Due to this I can find it hard to get staff buy in as we may pull training or meetings at short notice to get work done, despite extensive planning - has anyone got any similar experiences or suggestions to share?"

The ideas of simple end to end processes, empowered people, a focus on team achievements and results, all done with the ultimate customer in mind are ones we would all like to embrace so isn't it all about using the most appopriate concepts to improve depending on where the company is and less to do with whether you are 'reegineering' or not... unless of course a company does need such radical, fast paced change?"

Quick changeover is perhaps most interestingly applied to service organizations. One of my favorite examples is an airline. It is no mistake that Southwest, the most profitable airline today, can 'changeover' an airplane between flights in less than 30 minutes. Airlines make money when their planes are in the air. They do not make money waiting at a gate. Doesn't it make sense then, that the changeover process should be as quick as possible? But what about more mundane processes such as receiving function within an organization? I've seen packages wait 24 hours or more between being physically received and received into the 'system.' Why is this a problem? For lean companies, this is a huge problem because lean companies don't want to hold inventory for days or even many hours. Again, quick changeover techniques can be applied to allow product to be received as it is delivered with no delay.

Ultimately, the case for quick changeover is made by the value stream question: which activities are value-added and which activities are not? Invariably, time spent changing over between products, services, and customers is never value added. No matter the process, quick changeover techniques can help. "

I might dissagree with Debbie, although I have not seen an appliance in service sector, we tend to used ad hoc design experiment or trial periods in new service processes. Also quality of service and cost of service are parts of a similar concept.    "

If a surge is of sufficient quantity to warrant a 'disaster' situation then it should be managed as such with regular updates, a 'crisis' team drawn from appropriate parts of the business, and expectations and roles set accordingly. Forward planning should involve thinking radically about how to manage such as stopping project work, having all hands on deck, additional shifts / hours worked, etc. Triggers for implementation should be agreed and then activated and communicated by those empowered to do so.

We used to make a lot of installations, yet our margins would fall year after year.

Also, if you consider how flexible you can be in the of order of tasks, you may be able to flex your capacity to be more productive. The key issue for me is the monitoring of your capacity plans - remember that a plan is just a plan. For most companies, change is continual so the need to measure progress against plan and to adapt to changes is vital."

I guess Lean has many tools so it is a case of adapting these to work for you, it may not be pure lean but if it works and gains the benefits, without losing the overall concept of what lean is supposed to do around building Problem solving and standardisation of work then that is good

Overall though a very interesting read and study, it would be interesting if the study could revisit now and see what the impact is now and how they have developed their understanding of lean principles and tools"

Monthly i will sit with a member of staff looking at their process using the SOP. This is valuable time  with the member of staff looking at the process and understanding any frustrations and ideas they may have. When I asked the processor if they had any frustrations they commented that they always amend a certain part of a letter which was being sent to the client. I noted and printed copies so I could see. I logged this on a tracker and after investigation proved that there was no need to amend the letter it was just a nice to have but the letter had been signed off by all stakeholders so no amendment was required. The team stopped making the amendments and saved time in processing and also it showed the team that making suggestions did result in getting something done.

Understanding what adds value in customer service is a difficult thing to establish; being controversial, some non-value add from a staffing point of view is easier to explain from a cost angle than from a customer - this is particularly true in my environment where we don't really compete on cost, rather the focus is on customer service. Defining what is 'unnecessary' is a judgement call for services and likely to bring a whole host of opinions and arguments into play - for example, it is lean behaviour to continue personal visits by our salesforce? Possibly not, but is a key part of of our core company values and strategy so this will not change regardless of how costly this is. What can be done however is to look at how those face to face meetings can be more efficient? What do others think?"

I agree with the process mapping think, totally the right thing to do. But, in my opinion the overall results of the article are misleading. Back in 2002-2008 with the construction boom in Greece, KONE and Otis would used this system. They had back office people writing the technical offers and doing drawings while salesmen were out in the streets. Of course, the profits from new installations would be so high that justified these overhead back office cost. 
With the construction activity going down after 2008, these companies found themselves in adjusting their process and salesmen would prepare their own offers after meeting the client. When I started working for the elevator sector, under no circumstances the work load or the success % ratio would justify back office overheads. 
So what I&rsquo;m trying to say here is that: Before drawing an opinion, sales are a bit tricky and depend on circumstances, demand, hit ratio and product availability. 
In the current article, what I understand is that the CEO was saleing in a mature market of stable demand and of course his action was right, nevertheless we should be careful in avoiding generalities.

Focus on how to translate the direct factory floor actions and experience in anticipating a problem, to resemble relevant actions in business transactions and intangible services. When it comes to services, information is power! Data analytics is the modern tool that gives you that flexibility. From that point on, what you need is mapping your operations against the customer needs and focus on value added processes. Not a single information or complain should skip the monitoring system and a predefined response process should exist. Similar to how a factory uses kanban and process mapping to optimize process time and eliminate scrap, a service business should apply customer care, rewarding systems &amp; supply chain optimization. In a way, I think Zappos case, we have seen earlier, was fully applying Lean concepts. What do you think? "

In my business is we are reactive rather than proactive so we have to relate the to issue rather than being on the front foot looking for new business/processes. We are not good at linking up with other parts of the business asking them what future products are being launched that may impact us part of the business.
